Description: Tools necessary to reconstruct clonal affiliations from
    temporally and/or spatially separated measurements of viral
    integration sites. For this means it utilizes correlations present
    in the relative readouts of the integration sites. Furthermore,
    facilities for filtering of the data and visualization of different
    steps in the pipeline are provided with the package.
